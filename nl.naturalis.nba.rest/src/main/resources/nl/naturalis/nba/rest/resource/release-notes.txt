RELEASE NOTES V 2.06

* Solved issue 61. Sorting on nested fields now enabled.

* A new service with endpoint /release-notes has been
  created.

* A new document type, ScientificNameSummary, is introduced
  and exposed through the IScientificNameSummaryAccess API.

* A import program and shell script have been created to
  populate the ScientificNameSummary index.
  
* The import-all shell script has been modified. It still
  imports all data sources, but now generates a different 
  log file for each data source.
  
* More fields can now be queries using the LIKE operator.
  As a rule of thumb: a name-ish fields can now be queried
  using the LIKE operator.
