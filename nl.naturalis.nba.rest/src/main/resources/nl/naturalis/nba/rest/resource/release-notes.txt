RELEASE NOTES V 2.4

* NBAVTWO-7 Licence and copyright info for NSR is
  now provided by and set from NSR source files.
  
* NBAVTWO-113 There is a service that allows you
  to retrieve the names of all DwCA datasets for
  occurence data: /specimen/dwca/getDataSetNames
  
* NBAVTWO-116 There is a service that allows you
  to trieve the unitIDs of all specimens within
  a "special" collection (e.g. Arts, Sybold):
  /specimen/getIdsInCollection/{collection-name}.
  Use in combination with /specimen/getNamedCollections
  
* NBAVTWO-131 Language now set for species
  description within NSR Taxon documents
  
* NBAVTWO-147; NBAVTWO-148; NBAVTWO-149; NBAVTWO-150
  There are two typical grouping queries exposed as
  service:
  /<document-type>/getDistinctValues/<field>
  /<document-type>/getDistinctValuesPerGroup/<field>
  See javadocs for INbaAccess
  
* NBAVTWO-227 DwCA files for specimens now contain
  urls for associated multimedia in occurrence.txt
  
* NBAVTWO-242 You can now search using "whole dates"
  (format "yyyy-MM")
  
* NBAVTWO-282 For DwCA downloads of taxa synonyms
  are now written to taxa.txt rather than to a
  separate file.
  
* NBAVTWO-289 collectors field number is now set

* NBAVTWO-295; NBAVTWO-354 The ScientificNameGroup
  document type has been extended with the following
  fields:
  specimens.collectionType
  specimens.assemblageID
  specimens.identifications.preferred
  
* NBAVTWO-353 type status is now also set for
  multimedia objects
  
* NBAVTWO-356 The index.max_result_window configuration
  settings has been raised to 5,000,000. In other words
  you are now be able to specify a "from" parameter of
  4,999,990 given the default "size" of 10 documents per
  page (or 4,999,925 with a page size of 75 documents)
  See also e.g. service /specimen/metadata/getSettings
  
* NBAVTWO-368 You can no specify a query condition which
  is the equivalent of SQL's "WHERE 1 = 1" or "WHERE true":
  just leave field, operator and value all blank. See
  also javadocs for QueryCondition
  
* NBAVTWO-370 URL-type fields no longer support the
  LIKE operator
  
* NBAVTWO-380 There is a new metadata service that
  tells you which date formats you are allowed to
  use in queries: /metadata/getAllowedDateFormats.
  See also javadocs for INbaMetaData.


RELEASE NOTES V 2.3

* NBAVTWO-263 There now is a metadata service that
  gives information about various constants and limits
  pertaining to the operation of the NBA and the
  underlying Elasticsearch index.
  
* NBAVTWO-283 Data model change. The specimen's type
  status field has been moved to the specimen's
  identification.
  
* NBAVTWO-285 Data model change. The TaxonomicIdentification
  object within a Specimen and MultiMediaObject
  document now contains data from the associated
  Taxon document. This enhances searchability.
  
* NBAVTWO-291 There is new service for the
  ScientificNameGroup document: querySpecial. This
  service provides more intuitive query results than
  the stock query method.
  
* NBAVTWO-325 If you sort on anything else than
  document relevance, the score field in the query
  result will be null (i.e. absent) rather than
  NaN
  
* NBAVTWO-326 You can now explicitly sort on 
  document relevance by specifying the "_score"
  sort field.
  
* NBAVTWO-311 There now is a metadata service than
  returns all available NBA REST services.

RELEASE NOTES V 2.2

* NBAVTWO-285 Query specimens using taxonomic 
  attributes.
  
* NBAVTWO-324 Allowed operators for SummaryXXX objects
  (objects within the ScientificNameGroup document) now
  the same as for the full-blown counterparts.
  
* NBAVTWO-291 New document type: ScientificNameGroup;
  contains a "frozen" aggregation on taxon documents
  and specimen documents. Taxa and Specimens are
  grouped by their scientific name.
  
* NBAVTWO-317 associatedTaxonReference and
  associatedSpecimenReference field now contain true
  Elasticsearch document IDs rather than source system
  IDs.
  
* NBAVTWO-318 New metadata service: getFieldInfo,
  providing information about how/if a field can be
  queried.
  
* NBAVTWO-309 Document type mapping changes for one
  document no longer require all document types to be
  re-created.
  
* NBAVTWO-308 Index settings configurable per index.
  


=======================================================

RELEASE NOTES V 2.06
* NBAVTWO-61 Sorting on nested fields now enabled.

* A new service with endpoint /release-notes has been
  created.

* NBAVTWO-291 A new document type, ScientificNameSummary,
  is introduced and exposed through the
  IScientificNameSummaryAccess API.

* A import program and shell script have been created to
  populate the ScientificNameSummary index. The import
  program also runs as part of the import-all script.
  
* The import-all shell script has been modified. It still
  imports all data sources, but now generates a different 
  log file for each data source.
  
* More fields can now be queried using the LIKE operator.
  As a rule of thumb: a name-ish fields can now be queried
  using the LIKE operator.
  
* Less fields can now be queried using the MATCHES
  operator. All fields whose values are controlled and
  all fields that can possibly only contain a single
  word (e.g. rank names like "genus", "kingdom", etc.)
  are not analyzed using Elasticsearch's standard
  analyzer any longer and can therefore not be queried
  using the MATCHES operator.
  
* NBA Version now runs on Elasticsearch V5

* NBAVTWO-292 Name of log file in etl import script now
  includes name of imported document type.
  
* NBAVTWO-285 The specimen document type now contains
  a new object taxonomicEnrichments, which contains
  vernacular names and synonyms from associated taxa
  in our taxonomic systems (currently Catalogue of
  Life and Dutch Species Registry). This allows you
  to search for specimens using taxonomic attributes.
