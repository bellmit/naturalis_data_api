RELEASE NOTES v 2.17
* Several (minor) modifications to the data model
  to meet data requirements of two new data sets.
* Several extensions needed for creating DwCA 
  downloads.

RELEASE NOTES v 2.16
* This release is for shear technical purposes: we
  have moved from ant as build tool to maven. This
  gives us improved dependency control, transparant
  configuration and better integrated (unit) 
  testing.

RELEASE NOTES v 2.15
* Several new fields have been added to the document 
  types Specimen and MultiMediaObject allowing for 
  extra information to be stored (NBAX-148, NBAX-149, 
  NBAX-150, NBAX-151, NBAX-152, NBAX-153)
* The servcie getFieldInfo has been updated with a 
  description field. The description can contains 
  more information about the type of field, like 
  a reference to the metadate model (e.g. ABCD 
  Version 2.06).

RELEASE NOTES v 2.14

* NBAX-101 New feature in this release is a download 
  service. Up until now, documents could be downloaded 
  using the query service (limited to a maximum of 
  10.000 documents) or the DWCA downloaded service 
  (limited to a specific set of fields and/or the 
  csv-output format). The new download service does 
  not have these limitations. It instead allows
  a user to define the set size and select fields 
  according to the demand.
  
* Fix of some technical bugs (NBAX-9, NBAX-102, 
  NBAX-129, NBAX-130)

RELEASE NOTES v 2.13

* Main improvement of this release is the modification
  of exisiting and the creation of new aggregation 
  services. These services can be used, not to retrieve 
  documents (like specimen documents, or taxon documents)
  from the document store, but summary data about sets 
  of documents. Like, how many documents are there?, 
  or what are distinct values being used in that field? 
  - count
  - countDistinctValues
  - countDistinctValuesPerGroup
  - getDistinctValues
  - getDistinctValuesPerGroup

RELEASE NOTES v 2.12

* Fix of know issue (see v 2.11.4). Conditions 
  directed at fields in nested documents, are now
  related to other conditions in the same nested
  documents. Query results are now as expected.

* Rigigorous testing methods have been added to the
  ETL module. These tests ensure consistency of data
  imports over code changes in both the ETL module 
  itself, as in other modules as well.

RELEASE NOTES v 2.11.4

* KNOWN ISSUE The implementation for nested queries 
  has proven to be incorrect. Because of this, queries 
  aimed at nested objects, like identifications or 
  gatheringPersons, ignore the correlation between 
  the inner fields of those objects. This means that 
  searching with with more than one condition within 
  nested objects, will sometimes produce an inaccurate 
  result (generally, more documents than might be 
  expected).

RELEASE NOTES v 2.11

* NBAVTWO-478 The groupByScientificName services now
  use a query cache to increase response times of
  oft-used queries
 

RELEASE NOTES v 2.10

  error message

  now be null in case of missing data (not 0)

  status field has been moved to the specimen's

  associatedSpecimenReference field now contain true
  Elasticsearch document IDs rather than source system
  IDs.
  
* NBAVTWO-318 New metadata service: getFieldInfo,

  document no longer require all document types to be
  re-created.
  
* NBAVTWO-308 Index settings configurable per index.
  


=======================================================

RELEASE NOTES V 2.06
* NBAVTWO-61 Sorting on nested fields now enabled.

* A new service with endpoint /release-notes has been
  created.

* NBAVTWO-291 A new document type, ScientificNameSummary,
  is introduced and exposed through the
  IScientificNameSummaryAccess API.

* A import program and shell script have been created to
  populate the ScientificNameSummary index. The import
  program also runs as part of the import-all script.
  
* The import-all shell script has been modified. It still
  imports all data sources, but now generates a different 
  log file for each data source.
  
* More fields can now be queried using the LIKE operator.
  As a rule of thumb: a name-ish fields can now be queried
  using the LIKE operator.
  
* Less fields can now be queried using the MATCHES
  operator. All fields whose values are controlled and
  all fields that can possibly only contain a single
  word (e.g. rank names like "genus", "kingdom", etc.)
  are not analyzed using Elasticsearch's standard
  analyzer any longer and can therefore not be queried
  using the MATCHES operator.
  
* NBA Version now runs on Elasticsearch V5

* NBAVTWO-292 Name of log file in etl import script now
  includes name of imported document type.
  
* NBAVTWO-285 The specimen document type now contains
  a new object taxonomicEnrichments, which contains
  vernacular names and synonyms from associated taxa
  in our taxonomic systems (currently Catalogue of
  Life and Dutch Species Registry). This allows you
  to search for specimens using taxonomic attributes.
