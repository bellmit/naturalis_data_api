RELEASE NOTES V 2.06

* NBAVTWO-61. Sorting on nested fields now enabled.

* A new service with endpoint /release-notes has been
  created.

* NBAVTWO-291 A new document type, ScientificNameSummary,
  is introduced and exposed through the
  IScientificNameSummaryAccess API.

* A import program and shell script have been created to
  populate the ScientificNameSummary index. The import
  program also runs as part of the import-all script.
  
* The import-all shell script has been modified. It still
  imports all data sources, but now generates a different 
  log file for each data source.
  
* More fields can now be queried using the LIKE operator.
  As a rule of thumb: a name-ish fields can now be queried
  using the LIKE operator.
  
* Less fields can now be queried using the MATCHES
  operator. All fields whose values are controlled and
  all fields that can possibly only contain a single
  word (e.g. rank names like "genus", "kingdom", etc.)
  are not analyzed using Elasticsearch's standard
  analyzer any longer and can therefore not be queried
  using the MATCHES operator.
  
* NBA Version now runs on Elasticsearch V5

* NBAVTWO-292 Name of log file in etl import script now
  includes name of imported document type.
  
* NBAVTWO-285 The specimen document type now contains
  a new object taxonomicEnrichments, which contains
  vernacular names and synonyms from associated taxa
  in our taxonomic systems (currently Catalogue of
  Life and Dutch Species Registry). This allows you
  to search for specimens using taxonomic attributes.
